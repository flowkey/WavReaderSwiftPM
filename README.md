# WavReader (SwiftPM)

This example needs a wav file sitting next to the executable file to work.

Open the project in Xcode, build the project, then right click on `WavReader` under Products and choose `Show In Finder`. Add a file called `example.wav` in that directory and then you can run from within Xcode.
